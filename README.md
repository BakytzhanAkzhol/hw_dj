Homework 
Problems:
4.b. POST /api/v1/post/ - create new post
4.c. POST /api/v1/comment/ - create new comment for a post
 -- in JSON? or simple POST form?

4.d. GET /api/v1/post/<id> - get a particular post, list of comments must be included (Tastypie resource have a ListField field)
-- I Splushed to two json(post,comments) in one. But it's wrong way. Maybe, I find good way in tomorrow.
